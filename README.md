# Mini lab 1 for classification

In this lab, I will be using the iris dataset to classify the species of iris flowers. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample has 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is split into 3 classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. The goal of this lab is to use the features of the iris flowers to classify them into their respective classes.
### Also I create custom knn and svc function to classify points.

###  Here is the plot of the random points for svc method:
